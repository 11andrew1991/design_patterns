#   Design Patterns

##  Creational
>   Creational design patterns are used to design the instantiation process of objects. The creational pattern uses the 
    inheritance to vary the object creation.

2.  [Prototype](https://github.com/11andrew1991/design_patterns/tree/master/Prototype)


##  Structural
>   Structural patterns are concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures. Structural 
    class patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces or implementations.

2.  [Composite]()


##  Behavior
>   Behavioral patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. Behavioral 
    patterns describe not just patterns of objects or classes but also the patterns of communication between them. 
    These patterns characterize complex control flow thatâ€™s difficult to follow at run-time.

1.  [Chain of responsibility]()
2.  [Observer]()
3.  [Visitor]()
