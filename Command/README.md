#   Command Design Pattern


##  What is the Command Pattern
>   The intent of the Command Design Pattern is to encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting the developer to parameterize
    clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.
    
>   In general, an object-oriented application consists of a set of interacting objects each offering limited, focused functionality. In
    response to user interaction, the application carries out some kind of processing. For this purpose, the application makes use of
    the services of different objects for the processing requirement.
    
>   In terms of implementation, the application may depend on a designated object that invokes methods on these objects by passing
    the required data as arguments. This designated object can be referred to as an invoker as it invokes operations on different
    objects. The invoker may be treated as part of the client application. The set of objects that actually contain the implementation
    to offer the services required for the request processing can be referred to as Receiver objects.
    
>   Using the Command pattern, the invoker that issues a request on behalf of the client and the set of service-rendering Receiver
    objects can be decoupled. The Command pattern suggests creating an abstraction for the processing to be carried out or the action
    to be taken in response to client requests. This abstraction can be designed to declare a common interface to be implemented
    by different concrete implementers referred to as Command objects. Each Command object represents a different type of client
    request and the corresponding processing.

### Command
-   Declares an interface for executing an operation.

### ConcreteCommand
-   Defines a binding between a Receiver object and an action.
-   Implements Execute by invoking the corresponding operation(s) on Receiver.

### Client
-   Creates a ConcreteCommand object and sets its receiver.

### Invoker
-   Asks the command to carry out the request.

### Receiver
-   Knows how to perform the operations associated with carrying out a request. Any class may serve as a Receiver.


##  When to use the Command Pattern
-   Parameterize objects by an action to perform.
-   Specify, queue, and execute requests at different times. A Command object can have a lifetime independent of the original
    request. If the receiver of a request can be represented in an address space-independent way, then you can transfer a command
    object for the request to a different process and fulfill the request there.
-   Support undo. The Commandâ€™s Execute operation can store state for reversing its effects in the command itself. The
    Command interface must have an added Un-execute operation that reverses the effects of a previous call to Execute.
    Executed commands are stored in a history list. Unlimited-level undo and redo is achieved by traversing this list backwards
    and forwards calling Un-execute and Execute, respectively.
-   Support logging changes so that they can be reapplied in case of a system crash. By augmenting the Command interface
    with load and store operations, you can keep a persistent log of changes. Recovering from a crash involves reloading logged
    commands from disk and re-executing them with the Execute operation.
-   Structure a system around high-level operations built on primitives operations. Such a structure is common in information
    systems that support transactions. A transaction encapsulates a set of changes to data. The Command pattern offers a way to
    model transactions. Commands have a common interface, letting you invoke all transactions the same way. The pattern also
    makes it easy to extend the system with new transactions.
