#   Adapter Design Pattern


##  What is the Adapter Pattern
>   Adapter pattern works as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces. This type of design pattern comes under 
    structural pattern as this pattern combines the capability of two independent interfaces.

##  When to use the Adapter Pattern
-   There is an existing class, and its interface does not match the one you need.
-   You want to create a reusable class that cooperates with unrelated or unforeseen classes, that is, classes that 
    don’t necessarily have compatible interfaces.
-   There are several existing subclasses to be use, but it’s impractical to adapt their interface by subclassing 
    every one. An object adapter can adapt the interface of its parent class.
